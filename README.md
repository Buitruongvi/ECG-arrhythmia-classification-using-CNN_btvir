ABSTRACT

The Electrocardiogram (ECG) is the most effective, non – invasive way to diagnose and monitor arrhythmias. If knowing time, numbers, and type of arrhythmias, it will prevent dangerous heart diseases. Therefore, in the thesis “Classifying ElectroCardioGraphy (ECG) arrhythmias using Convolutional Neural Network” proposed a method using CNN – 1D model for automatic classification of common types of arrhythmias belonging lead II of 12 leads of the heartbeat.
The network structure CNN – 1D is built based on three network models: VGGNet – The Visual Geometry Group, GoogleNet – Google Network, ResNet – Residual Network, and combined with techniques to improve the model such as Dropout, Early Stopping. Then the model is trained and assessed based on the MIT – BIH arrhythmia dataset collected from 47 patients with arrhythmia.
The results are relatively high when dividing heartbeat into 7 different types including 1 normal rhythm and 6 common types of arrhythmias with accuracy and sensitivity achieved by the three networks VGGNet, GoogleNet, and Resnet respectively 99.258% - 97,774%, 98.964% - 96.885%, 99.318% - 97.740%. Last, this thesis concludes that VGGNet is the most optimal.
To summarize, this method can assist doctors in diagnosing arrhythmias, which is the first step to show the effectiveness of the application of CNN – 1D network in particular and Artificial Intelligence – AI in general on ECG signals.
